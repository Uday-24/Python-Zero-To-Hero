# Python Roadmap: Zero to Hero

## Phase 1: Python Basics (1-2 months)

1. **Introduction to Python**
   - Install Python and set up the environment (IDLE, VSCode, PyCharm, Jupyter).
   - Understand Python syntax and structure.
   - Learn how to run Python scripts.

2. **Basic Programming Concepts**
   - Variables, data types (integers, strings, floats, etc.).
   - Basic input/output functions (`print()`, `input()`).
   - Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`).

3. **Loops and Iterations**
   - `for` loops and `while` loops.
   - `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements.

4. **Data Structures**
   - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
   - List comprehensions and set comprehensions.

5. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Function arguments, default values, and return statements.
   - Lambda functions and anonymous functions.

6. **Error Handling**
   - `try-except` blocks.
   - Raising exceptions.
   - Creating custom exceptions.

7. **Practice Projects**
   - Build a simple calculator.
   - Create a to-do list app.
   - Practice coding challenges (HackerRank, LeetCode).

## Phase 2: Intermediate Python (2-4 months)

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Constructors and destructors.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
   - Magic methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.).

2. **Modules and Packages**
   - Importing modules.
   - Creating and using your own modules.
   - Explore Python’s standard library (e.g., `os`, `math`, `random`, etc.).

3. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files.
   - Context managers (`with` statement).
   - CSV file manipulation.

4. **Working with Libraries**
   - Install and use libraries using `pip`.
   - Explore popular libraries like:
     - `requests` for web requests.
     - `pandas` for data analysis.
     - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

5. **Working with APIs**
   - Understanding REST APIs.
   - Sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
   - Parsing JSON data.

6. **Basic Algorithms and Data Structures**
   - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.).
   - Searching algorithms (Binary Search).
   - Recursion.

7. **Practice Projects**
   - Build a personal expense tracker.
   - Create a basic blog using Flask or Django.
   - Automate a simple web-scraping task.

## Phase 3: Advanced Python (4-6 months)

1. **Advanced OOP Concepts**
   - Abstract classes and interfaces.
   - Mixins and multiple inheritance.
   - Decorators and property methods.

2. **Generators and Iterators**
   - Understanding `yield`.
   - Building custom iterators.
   - Using Python’s built-in iterators (`map()`, `filter()`, etc.).

3. **Concurrency and Parallelism**
   - Multithreading and multiprocessing.
   - `asyncio` for asynchronous programming.
   - Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its effects on threading in Python.

4. **Database Interaction**
   - SQLite and MySQL basics.
   - CRUD operations with databases.
   - ORM with SQLAlchemy.

5. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Unit testing with `unittest` or `pytest`.
   - Debugging with `pdb` or IDE tools.
   - Test-driven development (TDD) concepts.

6. **Web Development**
   - Flask or Django for building web applications.
   - Routing, templates, and handling HTTP requests.
   - Database integration with web apps.

7. **Practice Projects**
   - Build a REST API.
   - Create a multi-user blog or e-commerce platform.
   - Implement authentication and authorization in web apps.
